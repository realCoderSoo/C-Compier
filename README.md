The program involves the PLATYPUS Parser implementation. Part 1 involves Implementing a PLATYPUS Parser. Part 2 is an optional bonus for those of you who would like to have some challenge and would want to earn some additional marks (up to 3%). Part 2 includes some rudimentary semantic analysis, writing a PLATYPUS cross-compiler, or writing a PLATYPUS interpreter.
